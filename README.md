# Synesthesia
My partner has synesthesia so I created this program that allows you to pick the exact colour (or two) for each letter in the alphabet and digit. It allows you to do the following:
1) Pick the exact colour that your brain ties to each letter and digit
2) Display any text in this colouring (with adjustable intensity)
3) Replace any text with a â–  coloured accordingly to test whether you can read by looking at just coloured cubes!
